# Steps to Run the App
Download the code and run it.

# Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritize architecture because I believe it's the key to unlocking features like proper image loading, caching, and more. Additionally, a well-designed architecture makes your code easier for others to understand.

# Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spend about 5 hours. I worked on it different days due to my other activities.

# Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I guess networking layer is still a field for improvement. Localize strings is something that 
is missing.
I guess there’re should be a limit for image caching. Like, if there’re already 100 images start 
remove some of them and add the newest ones.

# Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
In my opinion, creating view-model instances to handle each row can be 
expensive in case the list of recipes is large.

# External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
No

# Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
No
